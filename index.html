    </div>
    <p>Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. 
      Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users. The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as lawn tennis.</p>

      <h4>History of tennis</h4>
      <p>The modern tennis game is associated with England, and in fact, it was this country that began to elevate this sport to new audiences and make it as popular as it is today, being proof of this the tournament of Wimbledon, which is the oldest Tournament of the world, taking place in London from 1877.
                Tennis is currently an Olympic sport, since 1988 in Seoul, but this sport had already been an Olympic modality previously and still for several years but was eventually removed, because there were still no rules so fixed and comprehensive on all sides. The International Federation of Tennis Rules solved this situation in 1924, and this was one of the reasons for the sport to start to evolve more and the emergence of more and more clubs.</p><br>        </div>
